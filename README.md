The Goal of the project is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007
As an exercise in exploratory data analysis, the goal is also to allow the student to explore data for personal understanding as a foundation for further work.
The use of line and bar plots enables succinct visualization of a small set of the data in the full data set.
